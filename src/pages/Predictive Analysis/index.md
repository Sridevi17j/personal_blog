In Predictive Analysis, we are going to see about below.
Once the Business Objective is identified, we have to identify the problem category. Machine Learning Model can be selected based on the problem category. So it is very important to identify the right problem category.
We have below problem categories.
- Forecasting/Prediction
- Classificatioin
- Optimization
- Unsupervised Learning

## Forecasting/ Prediction
If the predicted value is going to be continuos in number, then it is Forecasting/ Prediction type.
Example:- Cost of Gold Tomorrow ( Predicting some Numnerical Value)

## Classification
Predicting yes or No, is classification type.
Example:- Manufacturer wants to know whether the particular customers will buy their product or not.
Another example is a Banker wants to find customers who are mpost likely to buy the new loan product he is launching

## Optimization
Optimizing the business. It can be well explained with the example.
A hedge fund Manager wants to figure out how to allocate the funds he has amongst the ten different stocks he has chosen.

## Unsupervised Learning
We wont predict or classify here, Rather we just club customers with same characteristics. Its a segmentation clustering.

For every single project, we have to identify the Business Objective and then we have to identify which problem category it falls in. So that we can define the Machine Learning Algorithm.

## CRISP DM PROCESS
Majorly used method for Datascience project is CRISP DM PROCESS
CRISP DM stands for Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining.
It has six Major Phases. Those are mentioned below
- Business Understanding
- Data Understanding
- Data Preparation
- Data Modeling
- Evaluation
- Deployment

## Business Understanding
In this phase, we need to try to understand the end to end process of business. Domain Knowledge and Business Understanding is much improtant to define the Business Objective. Few projects will have the Business Objective defined already, we just need to start working on it. But in few projects,the client will just say "Optimize the Business", in this case,  we have to define the right Business Objective and then we need to start working on it.

## Data Understanding
To acheive the Business Objective, All we need is Data to be processed. So we get the required Data from the client. The data we recieve from client will be in different format. We have to understand the data, and identify whether the data is relevant to achieve the Business Objective. So that the next steps will be processed.

## Data Preparation
Prepare the data in the required format so that the Machibe Learning Algorithm process it without any issues. Preparing the data, involves like removing null values , and making the good quality of Data. Data understanding and Data preparation is the crucial partof Data Science. Because if we fail to make the good quality of data then the result will also be failed to give the right decision.

## Data Modelling
In this phase Model will be developed. Selecting proper Machine Learning Algorithm and developing Model and implementation of ML Model, will come into this phase.

## Evaluation
We have metrics to evaluate the Machine Learning Model, which was developed and implemented in the Data Modelling phase. Metrics differ on every problem category. Example- Machine Learning Model which is for Classification Problem will have different mentrics from Forecasting/Prediction Model. This part is also very important as this phase will tell whether the right Model was selected. 

## Deployment
Deploy the model, eiher in client side or deploy in our own host. We have two deployments, online and offline deployment.
