## Introduction about the blog
Welcome to the world of Data Science. If you are one who is very passionate about Data Science,
But Looking for some platform where you can start learning from scratch, then you are in right way.
Yes! I am starting to learn and i will update this blog with all my learnings, so start learning with me!!!!

Topics to be covered in Notes 1
- Data Science- Introduction
- Learning Path of this blog
- Data Science Specialization
- Work flow of a Data Scientist
### 1.Data Science Introduction:
As the world is emerging with Data, everyone wants to play with Data for some useful cause. Getting some usueful information from high volume of Data, has become the trend. This trend named as Data Science.
Now in the official words "Data Science is a scientific method, process, systems to extract knowledge ,insights from data.This Data can be either structured or unstructured.
Data Science = Maths + Statistics
### 2.Learning Path:
Below is the learning path of this course. 
    1. Statistics
	   1.a) Basic Statistics
	   1.b) Advanced Statistics
    2. Analytics
		2.a) Basic
		2.b) Advanced
    3. Machine Learning ( R and Python )
    4. Visualization Tools ( Tableaue )
    5. Databases 

### 3.Data Science Specialization :
Below are few fields in Data Science
	1. Speech Analysis
	2. Text Analysis(Natural Language Processing)
	3. Image Processing
	4. Video Processing
	5. Medicine Simulation
	6. Material Simulation

### 4.Work flow of a Data Scientist:
Sample work flow of a Data Scientist
- Understand the Business Problem- A Data Scientist, tries to understand the Business Problem in the right way by why's or interviews, questionaires with client. Understanding the right problem will give the right solution. 

- Data Acquisition- Once the business problem is understood correct, the start acquiring the data to solve the business problem. Data can be Webserver logs, DB Data, Online Repositories etc.. Data Scientistis tries extreme to get all relevant data to proceed further.

- Data Preparation-Data preparation is nothing but cleaning the Data which involves removing inconsistent Data Type, Misspelled Attributes, Missing & Duplicate Values.

- Data Transformation- It Modifies Data using defined Mapping Rule , Tools like Talend and Informatica to form complex transformation to understand the data better. In Simple words Changing the Data from one form to other needed form.
		  
- Data Analysis- It Defines and Refines  selection of feature variable that will be used in the model development. Deep Analysis of Data is taken place in this section.

- Data Modeling- Apply Machine Learning(ML) Algorithm like Decision Treee, apply on Data to identify best fit for Business. Trains the Models with Training Data set and Test, Select Best ML Model. ML Prefers python for Modelling the data.

- Visulization and Communication- Create Powerfull reports and Dashboards using Tableaue, Power BI and Qlick View and communicate the customer about how the business problem is going to be solved with the best fit ML Model.

- Deploy and Test and Maintain ML Model- Deploy and Test ML Model and Maintains the Model.

This is how a business problem is solved using the Data collected using Data Science. By completing this course,we will be knowing all these points in detail which is discussed above.
