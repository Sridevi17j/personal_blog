We use Jargons in statistics, which differs based on domain. There are few Jargons listed below.
- Sample
- Variable
- Data (Singular)
- Data (Plural)
- Experiment
- Parameter
- Population
Now we will see the definition of every one.
## Population
A collection or set of individuals or objects or events whose properties are to be analysed. The entire raw data taken for analysis is called as population.
There are two types of population.
- Finite population (limited amount of data)
Example- Employees of the company
- Infinite population (unlimited amoun of data)
Example- Streaming of Data- Twitter Mining
## Sample
Subset of population is called as Sample. It is very difficult to study the entire population. So sample has been collected and analysed. The selected sample should reflect the entire population.There are multiple method of sampling the data. Few are...
- Systematic Sample
- Analysing
- Stratified (Simple Random Selection)
## Variable
A Particular column in the data set. A Particular characeristics about the data.
## Data Singular
The value of a variable assosiated with one element of population or sample. A Value within one cell is Data Singular.
## Data Plural
Set of values collected for the variable from each element belong to sample. Value representing whole particular variable is called as Data Plural.
Value associated with one single cell- Data Singular
Value associated with multiple cell- Data Plural
## Experiment
Planned activity whose results yield a set of data.
## Parameter
A numerical value summarizing all the data of an entire population. Example for parameter - Mean, Median, Mode
A numerical value summarizing all the data of a sample is called as Statistics.
