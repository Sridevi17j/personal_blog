# Data Science - Notes 2
In Notes1, we covered Introduction and all basic information. From Notes 2, we actually enter into the course.
Topics to be covered in Notes 2
- Statistics
- Basic Statistics
- Advanced Statistics

## Basic Statistics
Statistics is the science of conducting studies to collect organize and summarize, analyse and draw conclusion out of data. In Simple words apply statistics on Raw Data to get some meaningful information, or in another words, we can say like, change unorganized data into organized Data by the help of statistics techniques. Statistics gives first insights to business, It helps in narrow down the data.

Types of  Datasets we handle:
Primary Data  - Data limited within organization
Example- Data related to employees working in the organization...
Seondary Data - Data Available in Public
Example- Some weather reports which is available in the internet...

Uses of this statistics:
Statistics has been used everywhere, below are some example areas..
Healthcare, Education, Business, Insurance, Marketing, Telecom

### Different Areas of Statistics
There are two types
- Descriptive Statistics 
- Inferential Statistics

#### Descriptive Statistics:
- Its the first level of applying statistics technique on Raw Data to understand the meaning of it.
- It give basic representation of entire population.
- Numerical and Graphical Technique is available in Descriptive statistis.

Numerical:
- Mean, Mode, Median, Variance, Standard Deviation and Percentage.
- Using above term, some better understanding of the data is achieved at th first level.

Graphical:
- Bar Graph, Scatter Plot, Histogram, Pie chart, Line chart
- Above are graphical representation of Data for understand the meaning within
  
#### Inferential statistics:
After descriptive analysis (understanding the data), but how you deliver your insights to client. 
Thats where inferential statistics comes into picture. 

#### Difference between Desriptive and Inferential Statistics
By explaining the difference between descriptive and inferential, we can capture these two easy!. "Descriptive statistics uses the data to provide descriptions of the population, either through numerical calculations or graphs or tables. Inferential statistics makes inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample of data taken from the population.

## Advanced Statistics
In Advanced statistics we are going to see below topics.
- Covariance
- Correlation
- Collinearity

### Covariance
If you have two variables x, y, How the two variables are related in a linear way is Covariance.
If Covariance is positive then, two variables have positive linear relationship
If Covariance is negative then, twovariables have negative linear relationship
Linear-(Constant and Variable connected throgh a straight line, in simple way relationship between variables)
       
Problem with Covariance
When the two variables are in different scale, its bit complicated to mention the covariance in a right scale.
For example, when you draw a connection line between height and distance, height will be in ft and distance will be in km, when you arrive to a point, 3000.. Is it a height? or Kilometer? How to sort this kind of issues?
To avoid this, we have correlation.
