# Data Science - Notes 2
Topics to be covered in Notes 2
- Statistics
- Basic Statistics
- Advanced Statistics

## Basic Statistics
Statistics is the science of conducting studies to collect organize and summarize, analyse and draw conclusion out of data.
- Raw Data----Statistics----> Meaningful information
- Unorganized Data - Statistics Techniques -> Organized Data
- Gives first insights to Business
- Narrow down the data

Types of  Datasets we handle:
Primary Data  - Data limited within organization
Seondary Data - Data Available in Public

Uses:
 Healthcare, Education, Business, Insurance, Marketing, Telecom

### Different Areas of Statistics
- Descriptive Statistics 
- Inferential Statistics

#### Descriptive Statistics:
- Its the first level of applying statistics technique on Raw Data to understand the meaning of it.
- Numerical and Graphical Technique is available in Descriptive statistis.

Numerical:
Mean, Mode, Median, Variance, Standard Deviation and Percentage

Graphical:
Bar Graph, Scatter Plot, Histogram, Pie chart, Line chart

   
#### Inferential statistics:
After descriptive analysis (understanding the data), but how you deliver your insights to client. 
Thats where inferential statistics comes into picture.


## Advanced Statistics
- Covariance
- Correlation
- Collinearity

### Covariance
If you have two variables x, y, How the two variables are related in a linear way is Covariance.
If Covariance is positive then, two variables have positive linear relationship
If Covariance is negative then, twovariables have negative linear relationship
       
Problem with Covariance
When the two variables are in different scale, its bit complicated to mention the covariance in a right scale.
To avoid this, we have correlation
