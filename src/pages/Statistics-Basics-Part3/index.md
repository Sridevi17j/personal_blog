In this notes, we are going to see about central tendency in detail.
## Central Tendency
It is a single value which tries to attempt to describe set of data. It helps to understand the data better> In simple words, it is a central position identification.
## Measures of central Tendency
- Mean
- Median
- Mode
Above are the important terms in statistics. When to use Mean and when to use Median and When to  use Mode, is very important in Data Analyis.
## Mean
We use Mean when the data has regular interval or ratio scaled  and the data are not skewed. Mean of a population is u, and Mean of sample is X.

Skewed data is nothing but,when we have 100 datapoints and 90 data points are below 40 and 10 datapoints are above 80. If you calculate mean, for this dataset we will get between 50-60 where there are no datapoints are between 50-60. we can not get accurate central tendency for this dataset, This data is negatively skewed, because mean comes between 50-60 but most of the data points are below 40. So...
In this case we go for Median.

## Median
Median is simple another name for 50%. Below is the way to calculate Median.
- Arrange the data in ascending or descending order.
- Divide data into equal propotion.
- Take central value.
The Median is often used when the distribution of scores is either positively or negatively skewed.It is the center value where half of the data points are lesser and half of the data points are higher.

## Mode
Mode is a score that occurs most frequently in a set of data. Mode is primarily used with nominally scaled data. When the data has labels, example we gave variable called Gender which has two labels Male and Female. This is called as Nominally scaled variable.
