## Advanced Statistics
In Advanced statistics we are going to see below topics.
- Covariance
- Correlation
- Collinearity

## Covariance
If you have two variables x, y, How the two variables are related in a linear way is Covariance. If Covariance is positive then, two variables have positive linear relationship. If Covariance is negative then, two variables have negative linear relationship
Meaning for Linear-(Constant and Variable connected throgh a straight line, in simple way relationship between variables)
       
## Problem with Covariance
When the two variables are in different scale, it is bit complicated to mention the covariance in a right scale.For example, when you draw a connection line between height and distance, height will be in ft and distance will be in km, when you get covariance value 3000, how to identify whether it is positively related or Mediam related? 
To avoid this, we have correlation which is explained below in detail, 

## Correlation
It is a scaled version of covariance. It tells the dependency between two independent variables. correlation varies from -1 to 1. If -1, then two variables are negatively correlated, if +1, then it is positively correlated, if 0 then no correlation.

## Difference between covariance and correlation
### Covariance
covariance varies from -infinity to +infinity
It provides direction of relationship 
It is dependent on scale of variables
It shows how much two variables vary together

#### Correlation
correlation varies from -1 to 1
It provides direction and strength of relationship
It is independent of scales of variables
It shows how much two variables are strongly connected

## Importance of covariance and correlation
They both help in identifying the dependency between variables. Mainly used in banking and finance sectors. To develop any Model, we need variables, and these two help in identifying the dependency between variables, which helps in reducing variables carrying same or dependent information. 

## Explanation in Detail
To build any Model, we need variables, Say for example if we have ten variables and we send all ten for Model, then Model will become more complex, so to save time, complexity, if we have any redundant variables,or any variables which are highly correlated, then we can remove one, if they two carrying same information.
