## Basic Statistics
Statistics is the science of conducting studies to collect organize and summarize, analyse and draw conclusion out of data. In Simple words apply statistics on Raw Data to get some meaningful information, or in another words, we can say like, change unorganized data into organized Data by the help of statistics techniques. Statistics gives first insights to business, It helps in narrow down the data.

## Types of  Datasets we handle:
Primary Data  - Data limited within organization
Example: Data related to employees working in the organization...

## Different Areas of Statistics
There are two types
- Descriptive Statistics 
- Inferential Statistics

## Descriptive Statistics:
Its the first level of applying statistics technique on Raw Data to understand the meaning of it. It gives basic representation of entire population. Numerical and Graphical Technique is available in Descriptive statistis.

Numerical Technique:
Key terms of this Numerical Technique are Mean, Mode, Median, Variance, Standard Deviation and Percentage. Using these terms, some better understanding of the data is achieved at the first level.

Graphical:
Key terms used in here are Bar Graph, Scatter Plot, Histogram, Pie chart, Line chart and graphical representation of Data for understand the meaning within
  
## Inferential statistics:
After descriptive analysis (understanding the data), but how you deliver your insights to client. 
Thats where inferential statistics comes into picture. 

## Difference between Desriptive and Inferential Statistics
By explaining the difference between descriptive and inferential, we can have a better understanding! Descriptive statistics uses the data to provide descriptions of the population, either through numerical calculations or graphs or tables. Inferential statistics makes inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample of data taken from the population.
