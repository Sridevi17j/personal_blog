We saw indispensable commands of R and Python for DataScience. Ofcourse what we saw is just a Wave and the Ocean to be crossed is still left out. But let us cross wave by wave, which will undoubtedly make us cross the ocean.

In this page we are going to see Data Preprocessing Techniques. Data preprocessing is nothing but preparing the data in proper format for further analysis. Like handling missing values etc. Below are some of the techniques.

- Missing Value Analysis
- Outlier Analysis
- Feature Selection
- Feature Scaling
- Sampling Techniques
  
Lets see few words about every topic and every single topic will be elucidated in a separate post.

### Missing Value Analysis
The Dataset that we have collected for analysis, may or may not have missing values, which means the column in the dataset may or may not have all the values. If the If particular variable/column has missing values more than 35% we need to drop that column itself.If less than 35% please proceed with filling up missing values. How to proceed with Missing value analysis will be explained in a separate post.
