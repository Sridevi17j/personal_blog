R is a Programming Language, developed in 1993, It is a open source Language and Domain Specific Language.
It is specially designed for Statistical Modelling and Graphical Methods. R includes Machine Learning Algorithm and Linear Regression. In simple words, R is a platform where we do analysis with Data and Develop ML Model and drive the conclusion. R handles lighter Datasets, for Datasets with higher in rows will be handled by Python.

## Tasks Using R
- We can write program for Data Analysis, Understanding.
- Using the Data we can analyse them and refine our hypothesis, 
- We can select the right Machine Learning Model as R provides wide array of ML Model.
- We can develop graphs based on our analysis and we can prepare outputs with R MarkDown, to share with clients.

## R Installation step by Step
- We need to install R and R Studio.
- R is a programming Language and R studio is a Platform for writing R Program, (Integrated Development Environment(IDE)) helps to develop programs in R.
- Download R-3.6.1-win.exe from Google for windows ( link- https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
