### Introduction
Python was introduced as a General Purpose language. It was initially used for Frontend, Backend, WebDevelopment. But Now it is mainly used for DataAnalytics due to the library specially built for this Analytics and Visualization.
### Why Python than R
Python can handle large amount of Data, Where R becomes slower to handle because it runs on RAM. But python runs in HardDisk  where we dont need to worry about storage.
### Download Python
Link for downloding Python- https://www.python.org/downloads/
I installed python for MAC, you can install based on your OS.
Since i installed python, i installed Jupyter Notebook, which is a web based interactive platform for running python code.
### Commands for Jypyter notebook installation
cd /usr/local/bin  (python installation dir in my sys)    
pip install jupyterlab    
pip install notebook   
### Command to launch Jupyter notebook
jupyter  notebook   
### Python libraries
Below are Python Libraries. Check the libraries and its purposes. When you know the purpose, it would be easy when we include them during programming.
#### Pandas 
Pandas is a dataframe in python. It is used for structured data operations and manipulations. Also used for DataPreprocessing and Modelling. Helps to have your input in structured way.
#### SciPy 
Scientific Python- Built on top of NumPy. It can be used for optimization and Advanced fourier transform.
#### SymPy
Used for Symbolic Computations
#### NumPy 
Numerical Python-Deals with Numerical Values, Contains basic Linear Algebra function, Fourier Transform, Advanced Random Number Capability, Integration tools with low level languages like c and c++.
#### Matplotlib
Designed for Visualization. But only for static images.
#### Scikit Learn
Helps to develop ML Models. Built on top of NumPy, SciPy, MatplotLib. It contains ML Algorithm.
#### Blaze
Used to access data from different DB.
#### Scrapy
Helps to start something from start to end.
Helps to scrap the social websites from start and dig through it.
#### Bokeh
Helps to generate interactive plots.
#### Seaborn
Helps to develelop interactive visualization. 
#### Statsmodels 
Helps to devlop Statistical Models, and Tests(ANOVA, CHI-Square)
#### os
Used for IN/OUT operations and File Transfer operations.
#### NLTK
Designed for Text Mining. 
#### BeautifulSoup
Used for scraping the websites. This is lower to Scrapy.
#### Requests
Used for accessing the web for IN and OUT operations

Hope it helps to some extent. We will start with python programming from our next.
